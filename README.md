# Database_Design_Project_2
My second project in database design.
This was a collaborative effort with 3 people where we were tasked to design, build and query a database for a small business: Ranier Brothers. The business is in small home-building and remodeling services and the company various categories of work for their clients. They also purchase products from various suppliers. **This repository contains the EER design, our tasked test queries to run, and the use case / initial structured data in an excel table later split into csv files. **
